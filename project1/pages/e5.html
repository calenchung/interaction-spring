					<a href="e6.html" class="b2-option option-b">The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out. </a>

					<a href="f7.html" class="b2-option2 option-a">A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them asked me: "Are you going to <dfn data-info="Scholar: patient, erudite, and solitary." class="stephen">Dr. Stephen Albert's</dfn> house?" Without waiting for my answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep me company. </a>
