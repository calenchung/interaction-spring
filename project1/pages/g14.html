An Irishman in the service of the English armed forces">Madden</dfn> broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist <dfn data-info="Scholar: patient, erudite, and solitary." class="stephen">Stephen Albert</dfn>  by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called <dfn data-info="Scholar: patient, erudite, and solitary." class="stephen">Albert</dfn> , and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</a>
