            <a href="f10.html" class="half">"A strange destiny," said <dfn data-info="Scholar: patient, erudite, and solitary." class="white stephen">Stephen Albert</dfn>, "that of <dfn data-info="Descendent of a wealthy and powerful Chinese family. Hates the Germans." class="tsui white">Ts'ui Pen</dfn> - Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on their publication." </a>
