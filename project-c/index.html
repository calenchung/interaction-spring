				Bahamas
			</h1>
			<p class="description">The flag of The Bahamas was officially hoisted on July 10, 1973, the date of the nation’s independence from the United Kingdom. It was the result of a local competition for a new national flag, although no single entry was selected. Instead, several entries were combined to create the new flag. The two aquamarine stripes represent the water surrounding the islands. The yellow stripe represents the sand and other rich land resources. The black triangle represents the people and their strength.</p>

				Benin
			</h1>
			<p class="description">The current flag of Benin has been adopted for the first time in 1960, when the country achieved independence from France. The flag consists of three stripes - two horizontal ones in yellow and red colors and one vertical green on the left side of the flag. These colors are traditional Pan-African colors, where green represents hope, yellow symbolizes wealth and red stands for courage and the bloodshed during the struggles for independence. These colors emphasize the solidarity with the other African nations. In 1975, Marxist government came to power in Benin and the country was renamed to the Republic of Dahomey. In these times, a green flag with a red star in the upper left corner was used. After the fall of the regime in 1990, the previous flag has been readopted.</p>

			<h1 class="title">
				Sri Lanka
			</h1>
			<p class="description">The "Lion Flag" of Sri Lanka was adopted in 1948, but it was used as a symbol of justice for a long time before. Its main motive is yellow lion on a red field holding a sword as a symbol of power. Green and red stripes were added to the left part of the flag after 1815 and these stripes are intended to symbolize Hindu Tamils and Muslim Maurs minorities living on the island beside the Sinhalese majority. Moreover, after renaming in 1972 from Ceylon to Sri Lanka, four yellow leaves were added to the lion´s field. Each leaf should remind one of the Buddhist values - kindness, compassion and desire to be a benefit for the society, joy, peace and well-balanced mind.</p>
