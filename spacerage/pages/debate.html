                            Purpose of Mission, Goals, Objectives
                            The NASA Strategic Plan establishes the Agency's mission and long-term strategic goals and sub-goals and forms the basis for NASA's mission. The Agency mission is achieved through strategic goals and objectives, which are pursued tactically through specific performance goals. Performance goals, which are synonymous with requirements, are met through programs and projects and are traceable down to individual performance plans.
                            <br><br>
                            How Mission, Goals, Objectives Support NASA's Mission
                            The Mission Support Plan (MSP) establishes mission support goals that will support achievement of NASA's strategic goals and sub-goals. The Mission Support Integration Plan (MSIP) defines and integrates specific goals, objectives, and risks to achieving the goals across five mission support functional areas: workforce, infrastructure, finance, information systems, and management systems.
                            <br><br>
                            As a NASA Headquarters mission support organization, EMD will develop an Annual Operating Plan that explains how the Division supports the NASA Strategic Plan, the MSIP, and the Office of Strategic Infrastructure Implementation Plan. Specific outcomes, measures and metrics will be developed for each strategic focus area to track our effectiveness in implementing the MSP goals and objectives.

They plan to send people on a one-way trip to Mars to colonize and see if it is habitable enough for the public. Others may not find that amazing, and that's okay. But please don't ruin it for those that do.

We're destroying earth now so if we do go to mars Are we gonna ruin that planet too. Plus now the U.S. is in a lot of debt and yet still giving tons of money to NASA, why? What's the point of seeing beautiful stars and nebulae while here on earth we are buying CLEAN water and BREATHABLE air when long ago these things were FREE. Can't NASA help us with that then using water purification. Help us and earth with what we have and stop inventing thing that cost lots when we could just use our brains to help, aren't we getting too lazy and relying on technology too much.

                                                    Of Course Not! NASA has not only benefited American history, but it also helped us invent many new technologies, research what's beyond Earth, and start sending humans out of Earth again. NASA has a lot of potential to help the human species. Here's why. 
                                                    <br>
                                                    1. We are getting overpopulated on Earth, and we are using all of it's resources. At this rate, Earth won't be Earth in 150 years. We must begin heading to areas like Mars, The Moon, Europa, etc, and start terraforming those celestial bodies. Terraforming is the process of making a celestial body more habitable.
                                                    <br>
                                                    2. Our economies could benefit from these resources, and we could employ thousands of people if space exploration is a success. Resources from other celestial bodies could be potentially valuable, which would be good for trading with other nations, and staying at the top of any other nation. These resource collecting, and space exploration feats could mean that we could employ several Americans to do missions, collect resources, operate stations, etc. 
                                                    <br>
                                                    3. The Sun will eventually get too big for us in the long run. The Sun keeps on getting larger, and larger. If we don't move farther from the Sun within the time that the Sun becomes a Red Giant (About 5 billion years), we're doomed. 
                                                    <br>
                                                    4. Horrible, unpredictable events could happen such as; meteorites, the moon getting too far from Earth, etc. The Moon of ours gets farther, and farther which will eventually affect our tides, orbit, etc. 
                                                    <br>
                                                    5. Why not? Would you rather stay on Earth, and be destroyed in 5 billion years? The human race is destined to head to space, and begin colon-
                                                    izing by 2040. If we don't have a space program, we won't stay caught up with other nations, and we will not remain the strongest nation. We must 
                                                    continue these great exploration feats. Exploration, and curiosity is 
                                                    not over.
